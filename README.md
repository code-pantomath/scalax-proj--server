# Scalax_Server

This is the server part of the scalax experimental project (for fun :) ), This server is basicly a bridge between the admin app and the client one that carries all communications and so carries the admin's virtual shell-like access to the client.

!- (The whole project was devoloped in a couple of hours and so isn't meant to be strongly written at all, therfore uses alot of bad stupid practices! :]

- This project uses .NET6 cross-platform console app template, signalR packages.
